This folder contains small Python programs focused on practicing **for loops** and nested loops.  
These exercises helped me get more comfortable with looping, especially when using patterns and ASCII characters.

###  Notes

**Goal:** become more comfortable using `for`, nested loops, and ASCII-based patterns.
